## repr() renders str literals with single quotes; this project's ruff profile
## formats with double quotes, so a generated revision would fail
## `ruff format --check .` in CI until someone reformatted it by hand.
## Revision ids are alphanumeric by convention, so the swap is safe, and it
## leaves None and tuple forms (merge revisions) rendering correctly.
